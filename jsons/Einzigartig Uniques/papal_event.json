In these times of spiritual upheaval, when heretics question the true faith and infidels hold the Holy Land, the Vicar of Christ seeks to assert his divine authority over temporal matters. The Church's coffers run deep, but its spiritual authority runs deeper still. How shall we answer this summons from the successor of Saint Peter?",
