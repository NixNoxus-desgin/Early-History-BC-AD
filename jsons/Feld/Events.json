Von den schlanken Türmen erklingt der erste Adhan - dieser archaische Ruf durchdringt nicht nur die Morgendämmerung, sondern scheint die Zeit selbst anzuhalten. Die Gläubigen strömen durch die schattenspendenden Bögen, doch was sich heute zusammenfindet, ist mehr als eine Gebetsgemeinschaft - es ist die Geburtsstunde einer Zivilisation, die die Kontinente umspannen wird.\n\nIn den weiten Höfen der Moschee, unter sternenverzierten Gewölben und zwischen Säulen, die wie Bäume eines paradiesischen Gartens emporragen, versammeln sich die Gesandten der bekannten Welt. Beduinen-Scheichs mit vom Wüstenwind gezeichneten Gesichtern, persische Gelehrte mit Schriftrollen voller uralter Weisheit, byzantinische Händler, deren Seidenroben den Reichtum Ostroms verkünden, nubische Krieger mit gebogenen Krummsäbeln, und Delegierte aus dem fernen Indien, deren Augen sowohl Neugier als auch Ehrfurcht vor diesem neuen Machtzentrum verraten.\n\nImam Abdullah ibn Masarra, dessen tiefblaue Augen die Weite des Mittelmeers und dessen sonnengegerbtes Antlitz die Härte der Wüste widerspiegelt, tritt vor die Versammelten. Seine Stimme trägt über den Platz wie der Wüstenwind: 'Brüder und Schwestern im Glauben! Der Allmächtige hat uns eine Vision geschenkt, die größer ist als alle Träume der Dichter. Von diesem heiligen Ort aus sollen wir sein Licht in alle Winkel der Welt tragen - nicht nur durch das Schwert, sondern durch die Poesie des Handels, die Eleganz der Wissenschaft, die Kunst der Diplomatie und das lebendige Beispiel unserer Zivilisation.'\n\nEin Raunen geht durch die Menge. Der alte Gelehrte Ibn Sina flüstert von den verlorenen Schätzen Alexandriens, die in arabischer Sprache wiedergeboren werden könnten. General Khalid ibn al-Walid, dessen Ruf als 'Sayf Allah al-Maslul' ihm vorauseilt, spricht von strategischen Eroberungen, die das Antlitz der Erde verändern werden. Der Händler Abu Bakr erzählt von Karawanen, die nicht nur Waren, sondern Ideen zwischen den Welten transportieren könnten.\n\nDie Mittagssonne steht jetzt hoch über den Minaretten, als der Imam seine Rede vollendet: 'Die Stunde der Entscheidung ist gekommen. Welchen Pfad wird unsere Umma einschreiten? Welches Erbe werden wir der Nachwelt hinterlassen?'\n\nDie Versammelten halten den Atem an. In diesem Moment liegt nicht nur die Zukunft des Islam - sondern das Schicksal der Zivilisation selbst in deinen Händen.",
