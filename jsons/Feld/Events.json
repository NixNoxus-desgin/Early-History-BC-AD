Seine Stimme ist kaum mehr als ein Flüstern, doch seine Worte hallen in der Stille: 'Ich bringe euch einen Splitter des Holzes, das das Schicksal der Welt trug.' Die Kunde davon, dass das Wahre Kreuz in euren Mauern weilt, verbreitet sich schneller als jede Armee. Schon am nächsten Tag lagern die ersten Pilger vor den Toren, ihre Gebete erfüllen die Luft. Händler preisen Andenken an, Krüppel hoffen auf Wunder, und fromme Bürger spenden ihren letzten Pfennig. Doch mit dem Ruhm kommen auch die Schatten: eifersüchtige Bischöfe aus Nachbarreichen bezweifeln die Echtheit und fordern die Herausgabe, und finstere Eminenzen flüstern von Diebstahl und Ketzerei. Ihr besitzt einen Funken des Göttlichen – doch haltet ihr auch der Macht stand, die er entfesselt?",

Kein ferner Einschlag auf einem Feld: Das Donnern kommt direkt aus den Burgmauern, begleitet vom Grollen einstürzenden Gemäuers und einem gellenden, doch rasch abbrechenden Schrei. Ein gleißender Blitz erhellt die Nacht, als er den Archivturm trifft. Die alten Holzbalken fangen sofort Feuer. Schlimmer noch: Der Mechanismus des eisernen Fallgatters ist beschädigt – es kracht herab und schließt Menschen im brennenden Archiv ein! Ihr wisst sofort, was das bedeutet. Im Hauptturm lagern nicht nur die Vorräte für den Winter, sondern auch die Kasse eures Lehnsherrn und – weitaus wichtiger – das Archiv mit den Lehnsbriefen, Steuerverzeichnissen und dem Siegel. Der Verlust dieser Urkunden wäre eine Katastrophe, die die Herrschaft eures Grafen auf wackelige Füße stellen würde. Der Ruf nach Wasser und Männern hallt durch die Gänge, doch euer Burgvogt, ein gestandener Krieger mit einer Narbe quer über der Wange, stürzt aus dem Wachhaus zu euch. Sein Mantel flattert im Sturm. Er packt euch am Arm, seine Stimme ein heiseres Flüstern gegen das Tosen: „Beim Blut Christi! Der Blitz! Er hat den Hauptturm getroffen! Das Archiv! Hört zu! Das Dach des Archivs brennt, trotz des Regens! Das alte Holz fängt schnell Feuer. Und schlimmer noch... der Blitzeinschlag muss die Fallgittermechanik im Turm beschädigt haben. Das Hauptgitter vor dem Archiv ist heruntergefallen und blockiert den Zugang vom Treppenhaus. Wer im Archiv war, ist gefangen – und das Feuer frisst sich von oben nach unten.“ Er mustert euch, sein Blick sucht nach einem Funken Verstand in dieser chaotischen Situation. Ihr kennt die alten Gemäuer besser als die meisten. Es gibt doch diesen vergessenen Abortschacht, der von den unteren Lagerräumen bis zur Latrine im ersten Stock des Turms führte. Der Schacht sollte längst zugemauert sein, aber Meister Konrad meinte neulich, er habe bei Reparaturen eine lose Steinplatte entdeckt. Vielleicht... vielleicht ist das ein Weg, am Gitter vorbei in das Archiv zu gelangen. Doch er ist eng, finster und einsturzgefährdet.

Von den schlanken Türmen erklingt der erste Adhan - dieser archaische Ruf durchdringt nicht nur die Morgendämmerung, sondern scheint die Zeit selbst anzuhalten. Die Gläubigen strömen durch die schattenspendenden Bögen, doch was sich heute zusammenfindet, ist mehr als eine Gebetsgemeinschaft - es ist die Geburtsstunde einer Zivilisation, die die Kontinente umspannen wird.\n\nIn den weiten Höfen der Moschee, unter sternenverzierten Gewölben und zwischen Säulen, die wie Bäume eines paradiesischen Gartens emporragen, versammeln sich die Gesandten der bekannten Welt. Beduinen-Scheichs mit vom Wüstenwind gezeichneten Gesichtern, persische Gelehrte mit Schriftrollen voller uralter Weisheit, byzantinische Händler, deren Seidenroben den Reichtum Ostroms verkünden, nubische Krieger mit gebogenen Krummsäbeln, und Delegierte aus dem fernen Indien, deren Augen sowohl Neugier als auch Ehrfurcht vor diesem neuen Machtzentrum verraten.\n\nImam Abdullah ibn Masarra, dessen tiefblaue Augen die Weite des Mittelmeers und dessen sonnengegerbtes Antlitz die Härte der Wüste widerspiegelt, tritt vor die Versammelten. Seine Stimme trägt über den Platz wie der Wüstenwind: 'Brüder und Schwestern im Glauben! Der Allmächtige hat uns eine Vision geschenkt, die größer ist als alle Träume der Dichter. Von diesem heiligen Ort aus sollen wir sein Licht in alle Winkel der Welt tragen - nicht nur durch das Schwert, sondern durch die Poesie des Handels, die Eleganz der Wissenschaft, die Kunst der Diplomatie und das lebendige Beispiel unserer Zivilisation.'\n\nEin Raunen geht durch die Menge. Der alte Gelehrte Ibn Sina flüstert von den verlorenen Schätzen Alexandriens, die in arabischer Sprache wiedergeboren werden könnten. General Khalid ibn al-Walid, dessen Ruf als 'Sayf Allah al-Maslul' ihm vorauseilt, spricht von strategischen Eroberungen, die das Antlitz der Erde verändern werden. Der Händler Abu Bakr erzählt von Karawanen, die nicht nur Waren, sondern Ideen zwischen den Welten transportieren könnten.\n\nDie Mittagssonne steht jetzt hoch über den Minaretten, als der Imam seine Rede vollendet: 'Die Stunde der Entscheidung ist gekommen. Welchen Pfad wird unsere Umma einschreiten? Welches Erbe werden wir der Nachwelt hinterlassen?'\n\nDie Versammelten halten den Atem an. In diesem Moment liegt nicht nur die Zukunft des Islam - sondern das Schicksal der Zivilisation selbst in deinen Händen.",

Die Wölfe heulen näher an den Stadtmauern als je zuvor, ihre Augen leuchten hungrig im Zwielicht. Der Nebel kriecht wie ein lebendiges Wesen über die abgeernteten Felder und hinterlässt eisigen Raureif. Die Alten sitzen zusammengekauert an den Herdfeuern, ihre von Arthritis geplagten Hände deuten auf den ungewöhnlich frühen Rauch, der senkrecht in den bleiernen Himmel steigt - ein sicheres Zeichen für nahende extreme Kälte, sagen sie. In ihren Augen spiegelt sich die Erinnerung an Winter, die ganze Generationen auslöschten.\n\nDie Bauern murmeln besorgt uralte Reime: 'Wenn der Nebel im Herbst nicht weicht, der Winter mit eisiger Faust erreicht.' Selbst die Tiere scheinen die drohende Gefahr zu spüren; das Vieh ist unruhig, und die Hunde knurren in die hereinbrechende Dunkelheit.\n\nDer schlimmste Winter seit Menschengedenken kündigt sich an - ein Winter, von dem nur in Legenden und in den ältesten Chroniken die Rede ist.",

Er trägt ein Manuskript bei sich, den 'Malleus Maleficarum', und verlangt im Namen des Papstes und der Heiligen Inquisition volle Autorität, um die vermeintliche Hexenverschwörung in Eurem Reich auszurotten. Seine Augen brennen mit einem unheiligen Eifer, und sein Versprechen, Ordnung und göttlichen Willen wiederherzustellen, ist verlockend. Doch der Preis für diese 'Säuberung' könnte die Seele Eures Volkes und den Wohlstand Eures Landes sein. Wie reagiert Ihr auf diese düstere Forderung?",
