      {"text":"1.Keep in mind that Luxury Resources no longer provide any [Happiness] by default, they provide a large amount of [Gold] and development potential, however, 'We Love King Day' and city state quests still require Luxury Resources.

      {"text":"'Levy Army' units are free and can be summoned using [Call to Arms] function in any city with five or more population at cost of [Happiness]  and short term negative effects, [Call to Arms] status can be reverted by disbanding your levies in peaceful times using [Enact Policies] at the capital so that they can be summoned again."},
      {"text":"'Standing Army','Noble Army' and 'Mercenary Army' behave like normal units except 'Mercenary Army' can only be bought and requires a [Mercenary Office] to be built.

      {"text":"5.[Influence] is a new currency that affects the political status of your civilization. You get it by keeping the empire happy or choosing the right policies.
